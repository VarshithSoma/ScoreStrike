# ScoreStrike
ScoreStrike-Made a captivating game using JS, CSS, HTML. Leveraged JS DOM for dynamic web elements. CSS for attractive design. HTML structured game components. Roll dice, accumulate runs, compete!

In the game, two players take turns rolling a virtual dice. The dice roll is simulated using JavaScript's random number generation. The number rolled determines the player's score for that turn. If the number is not 1, the score is added to the player's current score. If the number is 1, the current score becomes 0, and it's the other player's turn.

Players can choose to "Hold" their current score, which adds it to their total score. The game continues until one player reaches or exceeds a total score of 50, at which point they are declared the winner.

The game interface, designed using CSS, displays the dice roll, current scores, and active player. The active player is visually indicated by highlighting their section. CSS classes are toggled to update the interface based on game events.

The game utilizes HTML structure to organize the game elements and provide the necessary framework for gameplay.

Overall, the game offers a simple and engaging experience, combining luck and decision-making. Players aim to strategically accumulate the highest score while managing the risk of rolling a 1. It's a competitive race to reach the winning score of 50 and emerge as the champion of the game.
